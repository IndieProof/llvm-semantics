The goal of this project is to give a complete executable semantics to the [LLVM assembly language](http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html) (LLVM IR). The language is being defined in the [K Semantic Framework](http://k-framework.org).

Please report bugs and feature requests using the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/davidlazar/llvm-semantics/issues).
