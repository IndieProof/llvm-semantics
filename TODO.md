- floats
    - primitive operations working
    - unable to bitcast floats
- varargs
    - `printf` is working
    - submit vararg patch to clang
- aliases
    - We might be done with this.
- standard library
    - create repo for modified musl
    - add back printf float support
- memory
    - simplify memory model (symByte idea)
    - handle arbitrary-width integers (iN)
        - `gcc-torture/20001111-1.opt.ll`: stuck on sizeof i1
- alignment
- vectors
- modifiers on everything
- pass by value
- structs constants
- looks like Typedef can have more than two things in it (strct-pack-1.ll)
- fixing printing 0x values (regstack-1.ll)
- numbered types
- unimplimented stuff in parser
- consider renaming types
