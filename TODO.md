- floats
    - primitive operations working
    - unable to bitcast floats
	- some floats still not printed (lcc-tests.c-semantics-tests/lcc-tests/cvt.ll)
- varargs
    - `printf` is working
    - submit vararg patch to clang
- aliases
    - We might be done with this.
- standard library
    - create repo for modified musl
    - add back printf float support
- memory
    - simplify memory model (symByte idea) (c-semantics-tests/unitTests/moreStructs.ll)
    - handle arbitrary-width integers (iN)
        - `gcc-torture/20001111-1.opt.ll`: stuck on sizeof i1
- interesting errors
	- c-semantics-tests/cil/test7.ll (prints 7 instead of -7)
	- c-semantics-tests/unitTests/bitfields.ll (hits bug cases)
- alignment
- vectors
- modifiers on everything
- pass by value
- structs constants
- looks like Typedef can have more than two things in it (strct-pack-1.ll)
- fixing printing 0x values (regstack-1.ll)
- numbered types
- unimplimented stuff in parser
- consider renaming types
- hudson "histogram" of top of K cell to identify problems
