1, cannot use alloca ..., addrspace(x) to alloca a memory with address space x.

2, document says half/float/double only allow 16 bit format but they can actually use use any number in clang.

3, u0x and s0x hex int number is just garbage in LLVM. 

4, x86_fp80 does not support 1.0 format constant but the LLVM document does not specify this. It is either the problem with LLVM or the problem with clang.

5, LLVM does not check the number of hexadecimal constants.

6, sometimes, zero and negative zero are not equal in LLVM.

7, frem is error-prone. what is allowed input is not clear.
